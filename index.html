        </h1>
        <div class="subheading mb-5">Pre-Business</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Sophia Mitchell and I am an 18 year old student currently attending the University of California, Riverside as a pre-business major. I was born and raised in Tokyo, Japan but moved to San Diego, California in 2017 which is where I am currently living. I am currently working as a hostess and a waitress at a family diner in San Diego where I have been working for 2 years now and am currently in search for a second part-time job to expand my work experience outside of the food industry. Though I have only had one long-term job in an official work environment, I have taken upon many other responsibilities and leadership roles and positions throughout my life that has made me the strong worker I am today. I have held multiple executive board positions in different clubs including the Japanese Organisation on campus, Athletic Organisation, and Social Justice Committee. Along with this, I have also held an event planning position, been the student representative for my grade in the student body council, and have been president of two clubs. Besides in-school work, I also have multiple hours and weeks worth of volunteer work and community service hours through working at the local food bank, multiple different animal shelters, and as a student leader at elementary schools to help the children learn and be monitored. Since I was young my parents have tried to raise me to be as well rounded as possible and this definitely relays to my involvement on campus, in my community, and online! While I was definitely very involved in giving back and in clubs on campus, and fine arts, I was also very involved in athletics. I was part of a very competitive swim team from preschool to 7th grade, and then also played a part in my school’s basketball, volleyball, and soccer team throughout middle school and high school. Once I moved to San Diego I decided to pick up yet another sport which quickly became both my artistic and athletic outlet- figure skating. Through being so involved in all aspects of my life I have met so many different kinds of people with such different backgrounds and through this I have truly learnt about myself as well. Through my involvement I have been able to learn about my strengths and weaknesses and I have been able to figure out what my true passions are in life. I have a love for and passion for the fine arts and love to incorporate that passion into my work ethic and habits through creativity and innovation. No matter what the circumstance may be, I truly believe there is always room for passion and creativity and I love to apply my skills to that. Alongside with that, my strengths and strong suits in organisation, leadership, and communications make me, what I believe to be, a strong candidate for any work field as I will make it my mission to help the company thrive, grow, and excel.<br><br>

        Throughout my move from Tokyo to San Diego, I had a lot of difficulties adapting to all the very extreme differences and changes. Whether it be culture, the language barrier, food, people, or the education system, nothing was the same to what I had been used to. However, though extremely difficult and strenuous, this experience was simultaneously the hardest transition but the most eye-opening and best learning experience I have ever gone through. Moving from an all-girl private catholic school to a co-ed public school was definitely strange. I had gone from holding multiple student council, athletic, and fine art positions on campus to knowing practically nothing about the school I had moved to. I went from knowing everyone in my tiny classes to not knowing a single name or face. I was the “new kid.” In a school with a very low transfer student rate, it was rare to get new kids… especially in the middle of one’s sophomore year so word got around very quickly about me. I felt the pressure to impress everyone and beat my own standards just to set the bar high for myself. I felt as if I had people to impress, but I was my worst critic. I went through such turbulent ups and down in terms of my mental and emotional state and it truly was such a roller coaster of emotions for the entirety of my sophomore year. Because of my constant drive and need to want to be better than my own self, I had grown such a bad habit that I had never had before which was just being way too hard on myself. I had grown to hate the way I looked, sounded, learned, worked, and anything else you could imagine simply because I had this drive and passion inside of me to satisfy those around me and meet up to their wild expectations of this “new girl from Japan.” I eventually did get very mentally unstable and very unhappy in this new environment while not realising this struggle was truly self-inflicted. Once my first year in my new school had ended I had made new friends going into my junior year of high school. I surrounded myself with people who were supportive and encouraging and taught me to accept and be okay with who I was and where I was in my life. I had quickly learnt that all my anxieties about pleasing others had just, ironically,  made me weaker which was the complete opposite from what I was looking for. Though my first year was definitely a painstakingly treacherous experience for my social and mental health, I do believe it is something that has made me stronger. “You live and you learn.” Through this experience I learnt to be more accepting not of others, but more towards myself. I have always considered myself to be accepting and open-minded of those around me but never really understood how truly important it is to be accepting of yourself in order to grow. I learnt to push myself in a way I could handle and was able to use my strengths into multiple clubs, extracurriculars, and the organisation I fell most in love with- band.
<br><br>

     All throughout my lifetime music has been the one very consistent part of my life alongside my family. From as long as I can remember I have had my hands and mouth on instruments, been listening and feeling notes and music, and been producing my own. I had been part of a school band from elementary school throughout my freshman year in high school, but it wasn’t until my move to California where I was able to join what quickly became my passion- marching band. Marching an instrument that weighed over 25% of my own body weight, learning to roll step to keep a clean tone, consistently hitting my dots, and keeping formation all at the same time is physically strenuous, yet it is what I have grown to love and work hard on. Over time, I’ve learnt that it is more than the satisfaction of medaling gold in tournaments that drives me to pursue such a time and energy consuming activity. I truly love the art of playing my baritone saxophone and I am fascinated by the power that music can have over our lives. I can truly say that my diligence and perseverance to this activity has paid off. In the span of less than three years, I was nominated for two executive board positions, became the head event coordinator for a band with over 400 members, learned to market the program on social media and through presentations, and have been titled as the saxophone section leader for the largest section in the program. With this, I was also in charge and led what came to be the largest turnout of a band event beating the previous record of 34 participants to over 160. Not only am I the first student to have ever gotten these positions that I hold without having attended the high school for the full four years, but on top of that I am also the first female in my school’s history to hold these titles and positions. These opportunities have allowed me not only to learn more about myself and grow so much as a person, but have also allowed me to impact my peers. Historically, the saxophone section has had a bad reputation and was the scapegoat of the band. I was determined to dispel the negative stereotypes and free us from the labels that were attached to my group, and am confident to say I have succeeded. I am proud to lead this section and I am thrilled to be living, breathing proof that (as cheesy as it sounds) anything is possible as long as you have the motivation, passion, and love to achieve it. Through these roles I have held in my band program, I have learnt such important life skills that are applicable not only in the workforce but also just my everyday life. I have learnt the importance of time management and prioritisation, I have learnt to be patient and understanding no matter what the circumstances may be, and most importantly to myself I have learnt how putting in my time, dedication, effort, and passion truly does pay off at the end of the day. These skills make me the hard worker I am today and I am able to apply them to anything and all that I do.
